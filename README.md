# data processing package
In scientific search, photon signals captured by Photo-multiplier Tube (PMT) are digitized and recorded in binary format.
The captured photon signals are represented by pulses of various shape and amplitude. This is a C++ library used to extract features from digitized pulses in waveforms.
